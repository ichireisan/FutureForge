# Introduction


Hi, I'm Solomon John! I'm an Electronics and Communication engineer originally from Chennai, India. From a young age, I've always been passionate about Robotics, Embedded Systems, and AI/ML. I love building systems and finding innovative ways to solve problems using these technologies.

For over 13 years, I had the privilege of working at Cisco Systems in Services, Operations and Engineering. During my time there, I had the opportunity to build, implement, debug and manage complex systems, further honing my skills in the field.

Now, I'm focusing on learning more about ML to build advanced robots and embedded systems. I'm excited about the possibilities that this technology brings and I can't wait to see where it takes me next. I'm driven by my love for cutting-edge technology and the potential it has to change the world.

Currently, I am learning ML through courses from FastAI, Hugging Face,  Stanford Online and other online sources.
